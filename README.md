# Air Quality Monitor Arduino Uno

A real-time air quality monitoring system using Arduino Uno Rev3. This project measures particulate matter (PM1.0, PM2.5, PM10), temperature, and humidity. The data is displayed on a 16x2 LCD screen and analyzed to provide long-term insights. Alerts are triggered via a buzzer when air quality exceeds safe thresholds.

## Features
- **Air Quality Monitoring**: Measures PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10 levels using the PMS5003 sensor.
- **Environmental Data**: Reads temperature and humidity with the DHT11 sensor.
- **Visual Feedback**: Displays real-time data and long-term analysis on a 16x2 LCD screen.
- **Audible Alert**: Triggers a buzzer if particulate levels exceed safety thresholds.
- **User Interaction**: Toggle between real-time and historical data using a tactile push button.

## Components
1. **Arduino Uno Rev3** - Microcontroller board.
2. **PMS5003** - Particulate matter sensor for PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10.
3. **DHT11** - Temperature and humidity sensor.
4. **16x2 LCD Display** - Blue backlit display with parallel interface.
5. **Buzzer** - 5V buzzer with built-in driver.
6. **Tactile Push Button** - User input for toggling display modes.
7. **Power Supply** - 12V/2.5A adapter.

## How It Works
1. The system collects air quality and environmental data every 5 minutes.
2. Data is analyzed to determine real-time air conditions and stored for long-term analysis.
3. A push button allows users to switch between real-time data and historical analysis views.
4. If PM levels exceed safe thresholds, the system triggers a buzzer and displays an alert message on the LCD.
5. The buzzer can be silenced by pressing the button.

## Usage
- **Start-Up**: The system initializes and displays real-time data.
- **Toggle Views**: Press the button to switch between:
  - **Real-Time Data**: Current air quality, temperature, and humidity.
  - **Historical Data**: Long-term averages and trends.
- **Alerts**: When PM levels exceed safe thresholds:
  - A warning message appears on the LCD.
  - The buzzer sounds until silenced with the button.
